Jenkins Setup on AWS EC2
This guide outlines the steps to install and configure Jenkins on an AWS EC2 instance running Ubuntu.

Prerequisites
An AWS EC2 instance with Ubuntu.
A user with sudo privileges.
Steps
1. Update the System
Start by updating your system to ensure all packages are up-to-date.

sudo apt update

2. Install Java
Jenkins requires Java, so we will install OpenJDK 17.

sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y
Verify the Java installation:

java -version
Ensure it shows something like this:

openjdk version "17.0.x" 2021-09-14
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17.0.x+xx)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.x+xx, mixed mode, sharing)

3. Add Jenkins GPG Key
Next, you need to add Jenkins' official GPG key to your system for package verification.

wget -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null

4. Add Jenkins Repository
Add the Jenkins repository to your sources list.

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

5. Install Jenkins
Update your package lists and install Jenkins:

sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install jenkins -y

6. Start Jenkins
Enable Jenkins to start automatically on boot, and then start the service:

sudo systemctl enable jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins
Check the Jenkins service status:

sudo systemctl status jenkins
If the service is running, it should show the status as active (running).

7. Configure AWS Security Group
Ensure that you can access Jenkins by modifying the inbound rules of your EC2 instance's security group.

Add a custom TCP rule for port 8080.
Set the source to MyIP to allow access from your local machine.

8. Access Jenkins Web Interface
Open your browser and navigate to the following URL, replacing <PublicIPv4> with your EC2 instance's public IPv4 address:

http://<PublicIPv4>:8080

9. Retrieve Jenkins Admin Password
The first time you access Jenkins, it will ask for an initial admin password. Retrieve the password by running this command on your EC2 instance:

sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
Copy the password and paste it into the login form on the Jenkins web page.

10. Set Up Admin Username and Password
After the plugin installation is complete, you’ll be asked to create an admin user.

Username: Arnav2503
Choose your preferred password.

11. Install Suggested Plugins
Once logged in, Jenkins will prompt you to install the suggested plugins. Click on "Install suggested plugins" to continue.

12. Jenkins is Ready
Once the setup is complete, Jenkins will be ready to use!

Notes
Always ensure your AWS EC2 instance is properly secured with the necessary firewall rules and access controls.
The EC2 instance should be monitored for security and performance, especially when hosting Jenkins for production workloads.
